## FAQ ü¶Å

> **Q**: Can I add photos or other media to the entries?  
> **A**: Currently, WildWatch only supports text-based entries. You can add descriptions, but it does not support adding photos or media directly.
  
  
> **Q**: I accidentally deleted an entry. Is there a way to recover it?  
> **A**: Unfortunately, deleted entries are not recoverable, so it's important to be careful when using the delete command.

> **A**: Sure thing! You can edit an entry using the edit command. Simply specify the index of the entry you want to edit and provide the updated information. For example, you can use `edit I/1 D/02-03-2024` to edit the date of the first entry.
