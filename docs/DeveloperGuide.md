## Introduction üêª

Welcome aboard fellow animal lover! We are really excited to have you here! üòâ Wildwatch is a program for a clerk managing wildlife data in a wildlife reserve via the [Command Line Interface (CLI)](#glossary-). Its main job is to store and present animal data required in everyday operations of the wildlife reserve.  

### Purpose
This document specifies the architectural and software design decisions in the implementation of the WildWatch.  
For a detailed guide on how to use the program and explanations on the individual commands, we have our very own [**WildWatch User Guide**](https://ay2324s1-cs2113t-w11-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html) for your perusal.

## Quick Start üêµ

1. Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer. (How do I install [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11)? What is my [Java version](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/version_manual.html)?)
   
2. Download the latest `WildWatch.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file into the folder you want to use as the [home folder](#glossary-) for your WildWatch.

4. Open a [command terminal](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/command-line-for-beginners/), `cd` into the home folder you put the jar file in, and run the following command: `java -jar WildWatch.jar`.
You should see the welcome screen as the diagram below.

5. Type commands  beside `>>>` and press `Enter` to execute it.   
(e.g. typing `help` and pressing `Enter` will show the help page).  

```

## Design & Implementation üê∏

### System Architecture

![System Architecture](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/assets/69474977/90309a3c-f784-4ffb-8eef-65735c05ec52)

The **_Architecture Diagram_** above shows a high-level overview of the architectural design of WildWatch.  
Actual detailed implementation may differ from the architectural diagram.  
(e.g., `Parser` in the diagram encompasses the `Execute`, `Error`, and `Parser` packages).  
  
WildWatch is comprised of 7 major components.  
- `Main`: Entry point of the program.
- `UI`: A package that receives input from, and prints output to the user.
- `Parser`: A package that processes and interprets the input command of the user.
- `Command`: A package that does specific task according to the command of the user.
- `EntryList`: A package that stores all the wildlife data, while the program is running.
- `Entry`: A package that stores individual wildlife data, while the program is running.
- `Storage`: A package that saves and retrieves all the wildlife data from the local storage

![General Sequence Diagram](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/assets/69474977/6cef0c5a-c924-4f20-bf82-3ccee9eb61c0)  
 
The **_Generic Sequence Diagram_** above shows how the components in the architecture interact with each other for a generic command input in WildWatch.  
> ‚úè Note: `Command` here is a placeholder, and will be replaced by actual commands. e.g., `ListCommand`.
  
### Main Component  
The `Main` component, residing as a method in the `WildWatch` class, which is the only class without a package, is the entry point of the program.  
  
![Main Class Diagram](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/assets/69474977/2745b29a-da1d-423e-b460-10f65dbc8e0d)  

[‚¨Ü Back to top](#table-of-contents)  

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
  
### UI Package  
The `UI` components can be found within the `UI` package.  
It prompts and reads commands from the user and sends the command to `Execute` package to be executed.  
Lastly, it prints an output message upon completion of the command, to show the success of failure of the command execution.  
  
![UI Class Diagram](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/assets/69474977/d44324ea-ca0a-4094-8082-32ddafc7e694)

[‚¨Ü Back to top](#table-of-contents)  

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
  
### Parser Package 
The `Parser` components can be found within the `Parser` package.  
It is responsible for parsing the input String of the user, and returning an appropriate `XYZCommand` class.  
If the input is invalid, it throws exceptions to the `Error` package for error handling.  
The **_Parser Class Diagram_** below shows how `Execute`, `Parser`, `Error`, `Command` classes of their respective packages work together.  
  
![Parser Class Diagram](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/assets/69474977/1c8a8ae1-a14d-427f-8ecd-aa5038fb4fc7)  
  
[‚¨Ü Back to top](#table-of-contents)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
  
### Command Package  
The `Command` components can be found within the `Command` package.  

![Command Sequence Diagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)  
The above sequence diagram depicts how WildWatch executes an `add` command.  

### EntryList Package  
The `EntryList` class can be found within the `Entry` package.  
It is resposible for storing all the entry data in an static `ArrayList` class.   
It is responsible for "getting" and "setting" values of individual `Entry` objects.  

[‚¨Ü Back to top](#table-of-contents)  

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Entry Package  
The `Entry` class can be found within the `Entry` package.  
Each `Entry` object holds the data of a single animal entry, residing in the static `ArrayList` maintained by `EntryList` class.  

![image](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/assets/69474977/ee46913d-dfc5-4fd5-85ef-53bb03546085)    
The class diagram above shows the relationship beteen the `Entry`, `EntryList`, and `ArrayList` classes.  

[‚¨Ü Back to top](#table-of-contents)  
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
   
### Storage Package   
The `Storage` components can be found within the `Storage` package.   
The components work together to read from previously saved file in the local memory.  
The entry data is then loaded into the program.  
If a valid command that changes the entry data is executed, the relevant changes are saved onto the local file.  

![image](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2113T-W11-2/tp/assets/69474977/e40d9399-a56e-4d4f-953a-024e1252054f)  
The class diagram above shows the relationship between the different classes in the `Storage` package.

## Product scope ü¶Å

### Target user profile

Target user profile for WildWatch is the clerks working in wildlife reserves, who manages the wildlife data.
Since our program is interacted through the [Command Line Interface (CLI)](#glossary-), someone who can type fast will definitely benefit from WildWatch.
This would significantly boost one's productivity.
Since clerks are already accustomed to typing and working with a computer, this program would be ideal for this user profile.
